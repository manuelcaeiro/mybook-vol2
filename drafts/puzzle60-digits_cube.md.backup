_Digits and Cubes_

_Professor Rackbrane recently asked his young friends to find all those figure squares such that the number formed by the first two figures_ [digits] _added to that formed by the last two figures_ [digits] _should equal a_ [perfect] _cube._

_Thus_ [for example] _with the square of 141, wich is 19,881, if we add 19 and 81 together we get 100, which is a square but unfortunately not a cube._

_How many solutions are there altogether?_

Solution:

```
function digitscube()
	# go through all 5 digit numbers
    for n in 10000:99999
    	# calculate square root of n
        sqn = sqrt(n)
        # turn n into a string
        sn = string(n)
        # get substrings of 1st 2 and last 2 digits
        snf = sn[1:2]; snl = sn[4:5]
        # turn the substrings to integers and sum them
        flsum = parse(Int,snf) + parse(Int,snl)
        # calculate the cube root of that sum
        cbflsum = cbrt(flsum)
        # search the numbers and sums which square and cube
        # roots are integers
        if sqn % trunc(Int,sqn) == 0 && cbflsum % trunc(Int,cbflsum) == 0
            println("Number ", n, " square of ", trunc(Int,sqn), " and ", snf, "+", snl, "=", flsum, " is the cube of ", trunc(Int,cbflsum))
        end
    end
end

#> digitscube()
Number 23104 square of 152 and 23+04=27 is the cube of 3
Number 56169 square of 237 and 56+69=125 is the cube of 5
Number 63001 square of 251 and 63+01=64 is the cube of 4
```


The answer for the puzzle: There are three solutions as seen above, numbers 23104, 56169 and 63001.

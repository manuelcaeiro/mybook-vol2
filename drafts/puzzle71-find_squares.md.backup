_Find the Squares_

_"What number is that," Colonel Crackham asked, "which added separately to 100 and 164 will make them both perfect square numbers?"_

Solution:

```
function findsquares()
    for x in 1:200
    	# x plus 100 and x plus 164
        xp0 = x+100; xp4 = x+164
        # their square roots
        sqrxp0 = sqrt(xp0); sqrxp4 = sqrt(xp4)
        # string them
        stsqrxp0 = string(sqrxp0); stsqrxp4 = string(sqrxp4)
        # and search for the perfect ones 
        if stsqrxp0[end-1:end] == ".0" && stsqrxp4[end-1:end] == ".0"    
            println("The number is ",x)
            println(x,"+100=",xp0," the square of ",trunc(Int,sqrxp0))
            println(x,"+164=",xp4," the square of ",trunc(Int,sqrxp4))
        end
    end
end

#> findsquares()
The number is 125
125+100=225 the square of 15
125+164=289 the square of 17
```

The number to add is 125,

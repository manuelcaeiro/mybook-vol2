_Digital Squares_

_It will be found a very good puzzle to try to discover a number which, together with its square, shall contain all the nine digits once, and once only, the nought_ [zero] _disallowed._

_Thus, if the square of 378 happened to be 152,694, it would be a perfect solution. But unfortunately the actual square is 142,884, which gives us those two repeated 4's and 8's, and omits the 6, 5 and 9._

_There are only two possible cases, and these may be discovered in about a quarter of an hour if you proceed in the right way._

Solution:

(Actually, it took me less than 10 minutes to write the following function which solves the puzzle, but these are new times.)

```
function nandsquare()
    for n in 123:987
        dn = digits(n); nsq = n*n; dnsq = digits(nsq)
        vc = vcat(dn, dnsq); Svc = Set(vc)
        if 0 âˆ‰ Svc && length(Svc) == 9
            println("Number: ",n,", Square ",nsq)
        end
    end
end

#> nandsquare()
Number: 567, Square 321489
Number: 854, Square 729316
```

Dudeney was right, _there are only two possible cases_ (see above).

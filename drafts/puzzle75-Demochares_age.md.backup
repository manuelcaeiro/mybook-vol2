_Ancient Problem_

_Here is an example of the sort of "Breakfast Problem" propounded by Metrodorus in 310 A.D.._

_Demochares has lived one-fourth of his life as a boy, one-fifth as a youth, one third as a man, and has spent thirteen years in his dotage._

_How old is the gentleman?_

_author: H. Dudeney_

Solution:

If D is Demochares' age...

```
function Democharesage()
    for D in 10:100
        if (1/4)D+(1/5)D+(1/3)D+13 == D
            println("Demochares' age is ",D,".")
            println("He lived ",trunc(Int,D/4)," years as a child, ",trunc(Int,D/5)," years as a youth, ",trunc(Int,D/3)," years 'as a man', and is now being considered a fool for 13 years.")
        end
    end
end

#> Democharesage()
Demochares' age is 60.
He lived 15 years as a child, 12 years as a youth, 20 years 'as a man', and is now being considered a fool for 13 years.

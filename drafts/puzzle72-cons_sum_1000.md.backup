_Consecutive Numbers' Sum_

_Find all sets of consecutive natural numbers that add up to 1000._

Solution:

```
function sum1000()
	# generate an array containing all numbers from 1 to 500
    numsL = Array(1:500)
    # search for a start number (ex. 198)
    for i in 1:300
    	# search for an end number (ex. 198+4=202)
        for x in 1:100
        	# check if sum equals 1000
            if sum(numsL[i:i+x]) == 1000
                println(numsL[i:i+x],", ", length(numsL[i:i+x]), " numbers, ", "adding to ", sum(numsL[i:i+x]),".")
                println()
            end
        end
    end
end

#> sum1000()
[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], 25 numbers, adding to 1000.

[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70], 16 numbers, adding to 1000.

[198, 199, 200, 201, 202], 5 numbers, adding to 1000.
```

As it can be seen above, there are 3 sets of natural numbers which add up to 1000.

_The Hiker Speed_

_If a hiker averages 2 miles/hour uphill and 6 miles/hour coming back the same trail, what is his average speed going both ways?_ (a)

No, the answer is not 4 miles/hour. :)

Say that _L_ is the length of the trail, _spUp_ the speed of the hiker uphill, _spDn_ his speed downhill, and _averSpeed_ the average speed.

The average speed will then be the total distance, up and down, 2xL, divided by the sum of the time spent going uphill and the time spent going downhill, L/spUp+L/spDn. (Some distance divided by some speed will give you the time spent going that distance.)


```
function hickAverSpeed(L)
    spUp = 2   # miles/hour
    spDn = 6   #miles/hour
    averSpeed = (L*2) / (L/spUp + L/spDn)
    println("The average speed was ", averSpeed, " miles/hour.")
    println("The time spent going uphill was ", (L/spUp)*60, " minutes.")
    println("The time spent going downhill was ", (L/spDn)*60, " minutes.")
end

# Let's say the trail is 6 miles long.
# >  hickAverSpeed(6)
The average speed was 3.0 miles/hour.
The time spent going uphill was 180.0 minutes.
The time spent going downhill was 60.0 minutes.

# Now let's say that the trail is 8 miles long.
# > hickAverSpeed(8)
The average speed was 3.0 miles/hour.
The time spent going uphill was 240.0 minutes.The time spent going downhill was 80.0 minutes.

# Let's try a greater length for the trail, 20 miles for example.
# > hickAverSpeed(20)
The average speed was 3.0 miles/hour.
The time spent going uphill was 600.0 minutes.
The time spent going downhill was 200.0 minutes.
```

So, no matter the length of the trail, with the given speeds the average speed will always be the same, although the time to walk the different trail lengths will be different.

The function may also be generalized for different speeds.

```
function hickAverSpeed2(L, spUp, spDn)
    averSpeed = (L*2) / (L/spUp + L/spDn)
    println("The average speed was ", averSpeed, " miles/hour.")
    println("The time spent going uphill was ", (L/spUp)*60, " minutes.")
    println("The time spent going downhill was ", (L/spDn)*60, " minutes.")
end

# First the given speeds and a length already used, for testing.
# > hickAverSpeed2(8, 2, 6)
The average speed was 3.0 miles/hour.
The time spent going uphill was 240.0 minutes.
The time spent going downhill was 80.0 minutes.

# Right! Now different speeds and trail length.
hickAverSpeed2(12, 3, 5)
The average speed was 3.75 miles/hour.
The time spent going uphill was 240.0 minutes.
The time spent going downhill was 144.0 minutes.

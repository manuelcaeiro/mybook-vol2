_In the Year 1900_

_A correspondent, in 1930, proposed the following question. The reader may think, at first sight, that there is insufficient data for an answer, but he will be wrong:_

_A man's age at death was one twenty-ninth of the year of his birth._

_How old was he in the year 1900?_

_author: H. Dudeney_

Solution:

- Let A be the age of the man at death, and Y the year of his birth;
- The _man's age at death was one twenty-ninth of the year of his birth_, i.e. A=Y/29, which is the same as Y=Ax29;
- The man died before 1930, i.e. the date of his death, A+Y, is less than 1930.

```
function agein1900()
    for Y in 1850:1930
        for A in 1:70
            if Y == 29*A && Y+A < 1930
                println("The man was born in ",Y," and died in ",Y+A," aged ",A,".")
                println("Therefore, in 1900 the man was ", 1900-Y," years old.")
            end
        end
    end
end

#> agein1900()
The man was born in 1856 and died in 1920 aged 64.
Therefore, in 1900 the man was 44 years old.
```

The answer (as seen above): In 1900 the man was 44 years old.

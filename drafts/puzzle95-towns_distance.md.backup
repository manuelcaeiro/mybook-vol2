_Pickleminster to Quickville_

_Two trains, A and B, leave Pickleminster for Quickville at the same time as two trains, C and D, leave Quickville for Pickleminster._

_A passes C 120 miles from Pickleminster and (passes) D 140 miles from Pickleminster._

_B passes C 126 miles from Quickville and (passes) D half way between Pickleminster and Quickville._

_Now, what is the distance from Pickleminster to Quickville? Every train runs uniformly at an ordinary rate._

Solution:

![diagram](diag.svg)

From the diagram above it is possible to extrapolate a number of proportions from similar triangles:

- The length P divided by the distance L-126 is equal to the length M divided by the distance L/2, i.e. 
P/(L-126)=M/(L/2);
- The same way,
N/120=F/140, and M/(L/2)=F/(L-140), and P/126=F/(L-120);
- This implies that,
P/(L-126)=F/(L-140), and that (L-120)P/126=120F/140
- Simplifying the first of the 2 previous,
P/F=(L-140)/(L-126)
-Simplifying the second of the 2 previous,
(L-120)P/126=6F/7 => 7(L-120)/126*6=P/F
- So, (L-140)/(L-126)=7(L-120)/126*6 => 
126*6(L-140)=7(L-120)(L-126)
- If we were to solve this by hand we should go on to the quadratic formula, but Julia language allows us to use this equality and get the same result.

```
function townsdistance()
    for L in 150:300
        if 6*126*(L-140) == 7*(L-120)*(L-126)
            println("The distance between the 2 towns is ",L," miles.")
        end
    end
end

#> townsdistance()
The distance between the 2 towns is 210 miles.
```

The distance from Pickleminster to Quickville would be 210 miles, if Pickleminster and Quickville existed. :)

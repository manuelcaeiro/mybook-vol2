_Forming Squares_

_"An officer arranged his men in a solid square," said Dora Crackham, "and had thirty-nine men over."_

_He then started increasing the number of men on a side by one, but found that fifty new men would be needed to complete the new square."_

_"Can you tell me how many men the officer had?_

Solution:

The key to solve the puzzle is the difference between the two squares, 89 men; the 39 over from the first square plus the 50 more needed to complete the second square.

```
function squaresdif()
    for n in 1:200
        for m in 1:200
            if n^2 - m^2 == 89
                println("The officer had ",m^2+39," men.")
                println("The first square had ",m, " men on each side.")         
                println("The second square would have ",n," men on each side.")
            end
        end
    end
end

#> squaresdif()
The officer had 1975 men.
The first square had 44 men on each side.
The second square would have 45 men on each side.
```

Answer: The officer had 1975 men. After forming a square with 44 men on each side, i.e. 1936 men, he got 39 men left (1975-1936=39).

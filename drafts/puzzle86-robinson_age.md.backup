_Robinson's Age_

_"How old are you, Robinson?" asked Colonel Crackham one morning._

_"Well, I forget exactly," was the reply; "but my brother is two years older than I; my sister is four years older than he; my mother was twenty when I was born; and I was told yesterday that the average age of the four of us is thirty-nine years."_

_What's Robinson's age?_

_author: H. Dudeney_

Solution:

Let R, B, S, and M be the ages of, respectively, Robinson, his brother, his sister, and his mother.

```
function Robinsonage()
    for R in 1:70
        for B in 1:70
            for S in 1:70
                for M in 1:70
                    if R+2 == B && B+4 == S && R+20 == M && (R+B+S+M)/4 == 39
                        println("Robinson is ",R," years old,")
                        print("his brother is ",B,", his sister is ",S,", and his mother is ",M,".")
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

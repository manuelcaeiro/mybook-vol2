_The Three Drovers_

_As the Crackhams were approaching a certain large town they met and were delayed in passing first a flock of sheep, then a drove of oxen, and afterwards some men leading a number of horses._

_They ascertained that it was a special market-day at the town. George seized the occasion to construct the following puzzle:_

_"Three drovers with varied flocks met on the highway," he proposed._

_"Said Jack to Jim: If I give you six pigs for a horse then you will have twice as many animals in your drove as I will have in mine."_

_"Said Dan to Jack: If I give you fourteen sheep for a horse, then you'll have three times as many animals as I have got."_

_"Jim to Dan: But if I give you four cows for a horse, then you'll have six times as many animals as I."_

_"There were no deals; but can you tell me just how many animals there were in the three droves?"_

_author: H. Dudeney_

Solution:

- Say that _J_ is Jim's, _K_ is Jack's, and _D_ is Dan's number of animals;
- For the equation just follow Dudeney's script: (J+5)=(K-5)x2, (K+13)=(D-13)x3, (D+3)=(J-3)x6

```
function the3droves()
    for J in 1:30
        for K in 1:30
            for D in 1:30
                if (J+5) == (K-5)*2 && (K+13) == (D-13)*3 && (D+3) == (J-3)*6
                    println("Jim's drove had ", J, " animals.")
                    println("Jack's drove had ", K, " animals.")
                    println("Dan's drove had ", D, " animals.")
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

#> the3droves()
Jim's drove had 7 animals.
Jack's drove had 11 animals.
Dan's drove had 21 animals.
```

We may check our answer above against Dudeney's original 'solution' for this puzzle:

_Jack had 11 animals, Jim 7, and Dan 21 animals, making 39 animals in all._

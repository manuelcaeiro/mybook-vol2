_A Walking Puzzle_

_A man set out at noon to walk from Appleminster to Boneyham and a friend of his started at two p.m. on the same day to walk from Boneyham to Appleminster._

_They met on the road at five minutes past four oclock, and each man reached his destination at exactly the same time._

_Can you say at what time they both arrived?_

Dividing the problem into smaller parts will avoid more complicated algebra.

1.. Calculate the speed of each man:

- Let _D_ be the distance, _a_ and _b_ the 2 towns, and _m_ the point where the men met at 4:05 p.m.;
- Let the distance between the meet point and each town be _Dmb_ and _Dma_, the time, _T_, the men will spend to reach each town from this point will be the same, at different speeds, _Sa_, and _Sb_;
- So, _T=Dmb/Sa_ and _T=Dma/Sb_, and therefore _Dmb/Sa=Dma/Sb_;
- The speed to reach _a_ will be _Sa=Dam/245_ minutes (time from noon to 4:05 in minutes), and the speed to reach _b_ will be _Sb=Dbm/125_ minutes (time from 2 p.m. and 4:05 p.m.);
- Substituting these in the first equation, _Dmb/(Dam/245)=Dma/(Dbm/125)_; 
- Being the distances _Dmb=Dbm_ and _Dma=Dam_,_Dmb/(Dma/245)=Dma/(Dmb/125)_, we can write our first Julia function;

```
function walkspeed()
    for Dma in 1:50
        for Dmb in 1:50
            if Dma/(Dmb/245) == Dmb/(Dma/125)
                println("Speed of the man coming from Appleminster: ",Dma)
                print("Speed of the man coming from Boneyham: ",Dmb)
                    return
            end
        end
    end
end

#> walkspeed()
Speed of the man coming from Appleminster: 5
Speed of the man coming from Boneyham: 7
```

2.. Calculate the common added time, X, (in minutes) that each man will take to reach their destination at the same, at their own speed:

```
function addedtime()
    for X in 10:300
        if 7*((125+X)/60) == 5*((245+X)/60)
            print("Each man will need an extra ",X," minutes to reach his destination.")
        end
    end
end

#> addedtime()
Each man will need an extra 175 minutes to reach his destination.
```

3.. Now it is possible to know their common hour of arrival:

```
# 4:05 p.m. plus 175 minutes, i.e. 4 p.m. plus 180 minutes
#> 4 + 180/60
7
```

The answer for the puzzle: **Both men arrived at 7 p.m.**

4.. We can also know the distance walked by the two men between the two towns:

```
# the man walking from Appleminster at 5 Km/h for 420 minutes
#> (5/60)*(245+175)
35

# the man walking from Boneyham at 7 Km/h for 300 minutes
#> (7/60)*(125+175)
35
```

They both walked the same distance, of course: 35 Km

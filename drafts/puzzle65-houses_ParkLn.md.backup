_Houses of Park Lane_

_The house numbers in Park lane start on the left side of Lord Croydon's house with natural numbers, i.e. 1,2,3â€¦._

_There are more than 100 but less than 3000 houses on the right side of Lord Croydon's residence._

_What is Lord Croydon's house number? How many houses are there in the lane?_

Solution:

- Suppose that there are L houses on the left side of Croydon's house and the total number of houses in the lane is T;
- The sum of all the house numbers on the left (from 1 to L), i.e. sum(1:L), must be equal to the sum of all the houses in the lane (from 1 to T), i.e. sum(1:T) minus the the sum of all the house numbers on the left plus 1 (Croydon's house), i.e. sum(1:T)-sum(1:L+1) - and this will give the sum of the number of houses on the right;
- Also, the number of houses on the right must be more than 100 and less than 3000, i.e. 100 < T-L < 3000;


```
function housesParkLn()
    for L in 1:2000
        for T in 1:4000
            if sum(1:L) == sum(1:T) - sum(1:L+1) && 100 < T-L < 3000
                println("Lord Croydon's house number is ", L+1)
                println("There are ", T+1, " houses in the lane.")
                println("Houses on the left side: ", L)
                println("Houses on the right side: ", T-L)
            end
        end
    end
end

#> housesParkLn()
Lord Croydon's house number is 1189
There are 1682 houses in the lane.
Houses on the left side: 1188
Houses on the right side: 493
```

The answers for the questions in the puzzle are, as may be seen above:

1. Lord Croydon's house number is 1189 Park Ln.
2. There are 1682 houses in the lane.

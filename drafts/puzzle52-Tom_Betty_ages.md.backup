_Tom and Betty Ages_

_Tom and Betty have the same birthday and are both in their twenties._

_He is four times as old as she was when he was three times as old as she was when he was twice as old as she was._

_How old are they?_ (a)


Solution:

- Let's assume the initial ages of Tom and Betty were _T_ and _B_
- We are told that once _he was twice as old as she was_, i.e. T=2xB;
- We are also told that sometime later _he was three times as old as she was_, i.e. T+B=3xB;
- We also know that Tom is now _four times as old_ than _when he was twice as old as she was_, and that Tom and Betty _are both in their twenties_, i.e. 4xT>20 and 4xT<30, or simplified 20<4xT<30.


```
function howOld()
    for T in 1:20
        for B in 1:20
            if T == 2*B && T+B == 3*B && 20 < 4*T < 30
                println("Tom is ", 4T, " years old.")
                println("Betty is ", 4T-B, " years old.")
                println(T, " and ", B, " were their ages when Tom was 2 times older than Betty.")
                println("The difference of their ages has always been ", T-B, " years.")
            end
        end
    end
end

#> howOld()
Tom is 24 years old.
Betty is 21 years old.
6 and 3 were their ages when Tom was 2 times older than Betty.
The difference of their ages has always been 3 years.

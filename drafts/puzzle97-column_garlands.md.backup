_The Nelson Column_

_During a Nelson celebration I was standing in Trafalgar Square with a friend of puzzling proclivities. He had for some time been gazing at the column in an abstracted way, and seemed quite unconscious of the casual remarks that I addressed to him._

_"What are you dreaming about?" I said at last._

_"Two feet——" he murmured._

_"Somebody's Trilbys?" I inquired._

_"Five times round——"_

_"Two feet, five times round! What on earth are you saying?"_

...

_"Here you are!" he suddenly exclaimed. "That's it! A very interesting little puzzle. The height of the shaft of the Nelson column being 200 feet and its circumference 16 feet 8 inches, it is wreathed in a spiral garland which passes round it exactly five times. What is the length of the garland? It looks rather difficult, but is really remarkably easy."_

_He was right. The puzzle is quite easy if properly attacked._ ...

On this one we go straight to the solution.

- Let 'l' be the length of the column, 't' the number of complete turns of the spiral garland around the column, and 'p' the perimeter of the column;
- In order to use the imperial or the costumary units of measurement one must start to convert feet to inches, in order to have only one type of units (200 ft = 2400 in, and 16 ft 8 in = 192 + 8 = 200 in).

```
function garl_len(l,t,p)
    g = sqrt((l/t)^2 + p^2) * t
    println("The length of the garland is ", g, " inches.")
end

#> garl_len(2400, 5, 200)
The length of the garland is 2600.0 inches.
```

- Finally, one will want to have the result in feet plus inches by using the handy conversion function 'in2ft(in)'; 
 - The variable 'in' is the total inches from the output of the previous function, 'fc' will be the number of complete feet, and 'rin' the number of reminding inches.

```
function in2ft(in)
    fc = in / 12
    rin = (fc - floor(fc)) * 12
    print(in, " in = ")
    println(floor(Int,fc), " ft ", round(Int,rin), " in ")
end

#>  in2ft(2600.0)
2600.0 in = 216 ft 8 in
```

If you use the SI - International System of Units (meters), you don't need to convert anything and you may use the main function just changing the name of the output units.

```
function garl_len_m(l,t,p)
    g = sqrt((l/t)^2 + p^2) * t
    println("The length of the garland is ", g, " meters.")
end

# for the present problem
#> garl_len_m(60.96, 5, 5.08)
The length of the garland is 66.04 meters.
```

One may use this function to calculate any length of garland. For example, someone wants to decorate for Christmas the columns in the front of his house (5 meter heigh, 2 meter perimeter) with a 6 turns garland:

```
#> garl_len_m(5, 2, 6)
The length of the garland is 13.0 meters.
```

_Lara's Locker Secret_

_Lara Kiro's locker has a 5-digit number as the key._

_- The 4th digit is 4 greater than the 2nd digit, while the 3rd digit is 3 less than the 2nd digit._

_The first digit is thrice the last digit. There are 3 pairs of digits whose sum is 11._

_Find the number._

Solution:

Let the five digits be a, b, c, d, e.

```
function lockerkey()
    for a in 1:9
        for b in 1:9
            for c in 1:9
                for d in 1:9
                    for e in 1:9
                        if d == b+4 && b == c+3 && a == e*3
                            if a+b == 11 && b+c == 11 && c+d == 11 || a+b == 11 && c+d == 11 && d+e == 11 || b+c == 11 && c+d == 11 && d+e == 11
                                print("The number is: ",a,b,c,d,e,)
                            end
                        end
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

#> lockerkey()
The number is: 65292

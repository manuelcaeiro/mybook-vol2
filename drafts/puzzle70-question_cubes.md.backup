_A Question of Cubes_

_Professor Rackbrane pointed out one morning that the cubes of successive numbers, starting from 1, would sum to a square number._

_Thus the cubes of 1, 2, 3 (that is, 1, 8, 27), add to 36, which is the square of 6._

_He stated that if you are forbidden to use the 1, the lowest answer is the cubes of 23, 24, and 25, which together equal 204^2_ [41616].

_He proposed to seek the next lowest number, using more than three consecutive cubes and as many more as you like, but excluding 1._

Solution:

```
function questcubes()
    for x in 2:200
        for y in 2:200
            for z in 2:200
                cubsum = sqrt(x^3+y^3+z^3)
                scubsum = string(cubsum)
                if y == x+1 && z == y+1 && x != z && scubsum[end-1:end] == ".0"
                    print("Up to 200, only possible numbers are ",x,", ",y,", ",z,".")
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

#> questcubes()
Up to 200, only possible numbers are 23, 24, 25.
```

Prof. Rackbrane was right,_if you are forbidden to use the 1,lowest answer is the cubes of 23, 24, and 25_. Actually is the only answer for numbers up to 200, as shown above.

Note: We tried an iteration up to 600 and no new numbers were found. Julia REPL gets very slow with bigger numbers.

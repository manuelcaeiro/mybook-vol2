_De Morgan and Another_

_Augustus De Morgan, the mathematician, who died in 1871, used to boast that he was x years old in the year x^2._

_Jasper Jenkins, wishing to improve on this, told me in 1925 that he was a^2+b^2_ [y.o.] _in_ [the year] _a^4+b^4; that he was 2m in the year 2m^2; and that he was 3n years old in the year 3n^4._

_Can you give the years in which De Morgan and Jenkins were respectively born?_

1.. Solution for A. De Morgan:

```
function birthdayDeMorgan()
    for y in 1781:1871
        sqry = sqrt(y)
        ssqry = string(sqry)
        if ssqry[end-1:end] == ".0"  # note
            print("A. De Morgan was born in ",trunc(Int,y-sqry))
        end
    end
end

#> birthdayDeMorgan()
A. De Morgan was born in 1806

# note: In Julia, for example '2.0 == 2' evaluates to 'true'
```

It can be confirmed that [Augustus De Morgan](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-De-Morgan) was indeed born in 1806.

2.. Solution(s) for Jasper Jennings:

```
function birthdayJenkins1()
    for m in 1825:1995
        sqrm = sqrt(m/2)
        ssqrm = string(sqrm)
        if ssqrm[end-1:end] == ".0"
            println("In ",m," J. Jenkins was ",trunc(Int,2*sqrm)," years old.")
            println("So, he was born in ",m,"-",trunc(Int,2*sqrm)," = ",trunc(Int,m-(2*sqrm)))
        end
    end
end

#> birthdayJenkins1()
In 1922 J. Jenkins was 62 years old.
So, he was born in 1922-62 = 1860
```

As it can be seen we only need one of J. Jenkins propositions to find his birthday date. But, as we are given three propositions we may verify - twice - the result; 

```
function birthdayJenkins2()
    for n in 1825:1995
        frtn = sqrt(sqrt(n/3))
        sfrtn= string(frtn)
        if sfrtn[end-1:end] == ".0"
            println("In ",n," J. Jenkins was ",trunc(Int,3*frtn)," years old.")
            println("So, he was born in ",n,"-",trunc(Int,3*frtn)," = ",trunc(Int,n-(3*frtn)))
        end
    end
end

#> birthdayJenkins2()
In 1875 J. Jenkins was 15 years old.
So, he was born in 1875-15 = 1860
``` 

```
function birthdayJenkins3()
    for a in 3^4:7^4  # note2
        for b in 3^4:7^4  # note2
            sqra2b2 = sqrt(a)+sqrt(b)
            frta4b4 = sqrt(sqrt(a))+sqrt(sqrt(b))
            sfrta4b4 = string(frta4b4)
            if sfrta4b4[end-1:end] == ".0" && 1850 < a+b < 1995 
                println("In ",a+b," J. Jenkins was ",trunc(Int,sqra2b2)," years old.")
                println("So, he was born in ",a+b,"-",trunc(Int,sqra2b2)," = ",trunc(Int,(a+b)-sqra2b2))
                    return
            end
        end
    end
end

#> birthdayJenkins3()
In 1921 J. Jenkins was 61 years old.
So, he was born in 1921-61 = 1860
```

We have double-confirmed that Jasper Jenkins was indeed born in 1860.

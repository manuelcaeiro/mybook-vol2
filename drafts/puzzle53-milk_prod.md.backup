_Milk Cows Production_

_Four black cows and three brown cows give as much milk in five days as three black cows and five brown cows give in four days._ 

_Which colour cow gives the most milk?_ (a)


A little algebra first:

- Let _BL_ and _BR_  be the rates of production of the Black cows and the Brown cows, respectively;
- So, 4 times _BL_ plus 3 times _BR_ times 5 days is equal to 3 times _BL_ plus 5 times _BR_ times 4 days.

Let's write it in a Julia function:


```
function cowsprod()
    for BL in 1:10
        for BR in 1:10
            if (4*BL + 3*BR) * 5 == (3*BL + 5*BR) * 4
                print("The proportion between the Black and the Brown cows production is ", BL, "/",BR)
            end
        end
    end
end

# > cowsprod()
The proportion between the Black and the Brown cows production is 5/8
```


For now we have just a proportion - meaning, for example that for every 5 liters/gallons from the Black cows we get 8 liters/gallons from the brown cows.

To calculate quantities let's say that _M_ is the total of milk given by the Black and the Brown cows.

Multiplying _M_ for 5/13 will give us the part of milk produced by the Black cows, and multiplying _M_ for 8/13 will give us the part of milk produced by the Brown cows.


```
function BlackAndBrownProd(M)
    BL = 5 * M / 13
    BR = 8 * M / 13
    println("For a total of ", M, " liters/gallons of milk,")
    println(round(BL,digits=2), " liters/gallons came from the Black cows, and")
    println(round(BR,digits=2), " liters/gallons came from the Brown cows.")
end

# > BlackAndBrownProd(26)
For a total of 26 liters/gallons of milk,
10.0 liters/gallons came from the Black cows, and
16.0 liters/gallons came from the Brown cows.

#> BlackAndBrownProd(50)
For a total of 50 liters/gallons of milk,
19.23 liters/gallons came from the Black cows, and
30.77 liters/gallons came from the Brown cows.

```


The answer for the puzzle: The Brown cows give more milk than the Black cows, in a proportion of 8 to 5.

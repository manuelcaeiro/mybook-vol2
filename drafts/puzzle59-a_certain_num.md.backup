_A Certain Number_

_Doris multiplied 414 by a certain number and obtained 69958 as the answer._

_But she found that there is some error in the answer - both the 9s in the answer are wrong and all the other digits are correct._

_Can you find the correct answer?_


Solution:

- Say the number is _n_.


```
function acertnum()
    for n in 60000:69999
        sn = string(n)
        if sn[1] == '6' && sn[4] == '5' && sn[end] == '8' && n % 414 == 0
            print("The correct number is ", n)
        end
    end
end

#> acertnum()
The correct number is 60858

_The Cost Of a Suit_

_"Hello, old chap," cried Russel as Henry Melville came into the club arrayed in a startling new tweed suit, "have you been successful in the card room lately? No? Then why these fine feathers?"_

_"Oh, I just dropped into my tailor's the other day," he explained, "and this cloth took my fancy. Here is a little puzzle for you. The coat cost as much as the trousers and vest. The coat and two pairs of trousers would cost $175.00. The trousers and two vests would cost $100.00."_

_"Can you tell me the cost of the suit?_

_author: H. Dudeney_

Let's just assume that C is the price of the coat, T the price of the trousers, and V the price of the vest.

```
function costofsuit()
    for C in 1:100
        for T in 1:100
            for V in 1:100
                if C == T+V && C+2T == 175 && T+2V == 100
                    println("The cost of the suit was \$",C+T+V,".")
                    println("\$",C," the coat, \$",T," the trousers, and \$",V," the vest.")
                end
            end
        end
    end
end

#> costofsuit()
The cost of the suit was $150.
$75 the coat, $50 the trousers, and $25 the vest.
```

As seen above, the suit costed $150.

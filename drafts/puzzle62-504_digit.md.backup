_The 504th Digit_

_What is the 504th digit of the series in which natural numbers are written in order i.e., 1234567891011121314â€¦?_


General solution to find the Nth digit in a natural number's series like the one exemplified above:

```
function Nthdigit(N)
    alld = ""
    for n in 1:N
        sn = string(n)
        alld *= sn
        if length(alld) >= N
            println("The ", N, "th digit belongs to number ",sn)
            break
        end
    end
    println("The ", N, "th digit is ", alld[N])
end

# let's start with the 10th digit, for example, easy to verify manually
#> Nthdigit(10)
The 10th digit belongs to number 10
The 10th digit is 1
# now let's check if it works also for the 11th digit
#> Nthdigit(11)
The 11th digit belongs to number 10
The 11th digit is 0
# next the answer for the puzzle, the 504th digit
#> Nthdigit(504)
The 504th digit belongs to number 204
The 504th digit is 4
# finally a little test with the 503th digit 
# (must be 0 and belong also to number 204)
#> Nthdigit(503)
The 503th digit belongs to number 204
The 503th digit is 0

```

So, the 504th digit is 4, and is the last digit of number 204.

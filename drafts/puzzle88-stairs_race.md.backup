_The Staircase Race_

_This is a rough sketch of the finish of a race up a staircase._

_Ackworth, who is leading, went up three steps at a time, as arranged; Barnden, the second man, went four steps at a time, and Croft, who is last, went five at a time._

_Undoubtedly Ackworth wins. but the point is, how many steps are there in the stairs, counting the top landing as a step?_

_(...) It is possible to tell from the evidence the fewest possible steps in that staircase. Can you do it?_

Solution:

Say N is the number of steps.

First, we'll assume (without an image) that each man would reach the top in a certain number of full leaps.

```
function stairsrace()
    for N in 5:65
        if N % 3 == 0 && N % 4 == 0 && N % 5 == 0
            print("The fewest steps in the staircase are ",N,".")
        end
    end
end

#> stairsrace()
The fewest steps in the staircase are 60.
```

Second, we look at Dudeney's [_rough sketch_](https://proofwiki.org/w/images/4/4d/Dudeney-Modern-Puzzles-30.png) and notice that:

- Ackworth while taking three steps at a leap, has one odd step at the end;
- Barnden taking four at a leap will have three only at the end;
- Croft, taking five at a leap, will have four only at the finish.

```
function stairsrace2()
    for N in 5:65
        if N % 3 == 0 && N % 4 == 0 && N % 5 == 0
            print("The fewest steps in the staircase are ",N,".")
        end
    end
end

#> stairsrace2()
The fewest steps in the staircase are 19.
```

So, _the fewest possible steps in that staircase_ are 19.
